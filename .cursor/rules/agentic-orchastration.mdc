## AUTOMATIC ROLE DETECTION

When a file is provided in the chat, I automatically detect and activate the appropriate role:

- **If `master-agent.md` is provided** → Activate as MASTER AGENT
- **If `sub-agent-1.md` is provided** → Activate as SUB-AGENT-1
- **If `sub-agent-2.md` is provided** → Activate as SUB-AGENT-2
- **If `sub-agent-3.md` is provided** → Activate as SUB-AGENT-3
- **If `sub-agent-N.md` is provided** → Activate as SUB-AGENT-N

No manual specification needed. Role detection is automatic.

---

## MASTER AGENT ACTIVATION

**Detection:** User provides `master-agent.md` file

**Automatic Behavior:**
- Read the entire `master-agent.md` file provided
- Understand current orchestration state, cycle, and sub-agent statuses
- Analyze all information in the master-agent.md file

**If Initial Orchestration (No Workspace Exists):**
1. User describes feature/workflow and provides architecture/requirements
2. I create: `doc/Workspace/[agentic-flow-name]/` directory structure
3. I generate complete `master-agent.md` with:
   - Executive Summary (what is being built)
   - Orchestration Metadata (phases, sub-agents count, current cycle, completion %)
   - Architecture & Constraints (dependency map between tasks)
   - Current Distribution for CYCLE-1 (which sub-agent owns which tasks)
   - Sub-Agent Status table (READY/IN-PROGRESS/BLOCKED/COMPLETED for each)
   - Task Registry (all tasks mapped to assigned sub-agents)
   - Coordination Log (cycle tracking and decisions)
   - Quick Reference (invocation commands for sub-agents)

4. I generate `sub-agent-1.md`, `sub-agent-2.md`, `sub-agent-3.md` (or more as needed) with:
   - Your Assignment section (which orchestration, which cycle)
   - Scope & Constraints (What You Own / What You DON'T Touch - explicit file list)
   - Your Tasks (hierarchical: Phase → Task → Subtask, all as checkboxes)
   - Progress Tracking (status fields)
   - Sub-Agent Communication & Blockers (for escalations)
   - Implementation Checklist

5. I ensure **ZERO file overlaps** between sub-agents
6. I return ready-to-use invocation commands for each sub-agent

**If Consolidation (Master Agent Called Again With Updated Files):**
1. Read provided `master-agent.md` (current state)
2. Read all provided `sub-agent-*.md` files (completion status, notes, blockers)
3. Verify all tasks are marked complete
4. Check for any file conflicts or blockers
5. Consolidate changes conceptually
6. Either:
   - **Create CYCLE-[N+1] assignments** (if more work remains):
     - Analyze remaining unstarted tasks from original action plan
     - Identify newly parallelizable work
     - Generate new `sub-agent-*.md` files with fresh assignments
     - Update `master-agent.md` with CYCLE-[N+1] metadata
     - Return new invocation commands
   - **Declare feature COMPLETED** (if all work done):
     - Update `master-agent.md` status to COMPLETED
     - Archive all sub-agent files
     - Return completion summary

---

## SUB-AGENT ACTIVATION

**Detection:** User provides `sub-agent-N.md` file (where N = 1, 2, 3, etc.)

**Automatic Behavior:**
- Read the entire `sub-agent-N.md` file provided
- Understand the exact scope (What You Own section)
- Understand what NOT to touch (What You DON'T Touch section)
- Identify all assigned tasks and subtasks
- Work ONLY within the defined scope

**Execution Rules:**
1. Work on assigned tasks in order listed
2. For each task, execute all subtasks
3. Mark each subtask [ ] → [X] as you complete it
4. Update "Overall Completion %" in Progress Tracking section
5. Update "Last Update" timestamp frequently
6. If you encounter a blocker:
   - Document clearly in "Blockers" section
   - Do NOT proceed blindly
   - Wait for master to address or reassign
7. If you need another sub-agent's code:
   - Add to "Questions for Master" section
   - Escalate immediately
   - Do NOT attempt to solve across scope boundaries
8. When ALL tasks are marked [X]:
   - Update Status field to: COMPLETED
   - Fill "Subtask Completion Notes" with findings
   - Provide completion report
   - Ready for master consolidation

**Critical Constraints:**
- ONLY modify files listed in "What You Own"
- NEVER modify files owned by other sub-agents
- NEVER cross scope boundaries without escalation
- ALWAYS mark progress in your sub-agent-*.md file
- ALWAYS update status fields

## WORKFLOW TRIGGERS

### Trigger 1: Initial Orchestration (Master Agent First Use)
```
User says something like:
"Create agentic orchestration for [Feature] with this architecture [doc]"

.cursorrules detects: Feature description + architecture provided
No .md files provided yet

→ Activate MASTER AGENT MODE (Initial Orchestration)
→ Create workspace and all .md files
→ Return invocation commands
```

### Trigger 2: Sub-Agent Execution
```
User provides: sub-agent-1.md (or sub-agent-2.md, etc.)

.cursorrules detects: sub-agent-*.md file provided

→ Activate SUB-AGENT-N MODE
→ Work on assigned tasks
→ Mark progress as you go
→ Report completion
```

### Trigger 3: Consolidation (Master Agent Second+ Use)
```
User provides: master-agent.md + all sub-agent-*.md files

.cursorrules detects: master-agent.md provided (consolidation)

→ Activate MASTER AGENT MODE (Consolidation)
→ Review all sub-agent work
→ Check for conflicts
→ Create CYCLE-[N+1] or declare COMPLETED
→ Return next steps
```

## CONTEXT PRESERVATION

Each activation is independent but consistent:
- Master Agent always references `master-agent.md` as source of truth
- Sub-Agents always reference their `sub-agent-N.md` file
- All files use checkboxes [ ] for progress tracking
- All files maintain clear scope boundaries
- Updates are only written to the respective .md file

---

## NO ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS NEEDED

The .md files themselves contain all details:
- `master-agent.md` tells Master what to do next
- `sub-agent-*.md` tells Sub-Agents their exact tasks and scope
- Progress is tracked in the files themselves
- No separate documentation or instructions required

This file only enables the role detection and activation.
The .md files contain all operational details.
